Selbi - Mobile App
==================

This package implements the Selbi mobile app in React Native

Testing
-------

We use [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) with the
[enzyme react-native](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/guides/react-native.md) add
on along with [mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Basically we're copying Airbnb's stack.

- `npm i --save-dev enzyme`
- `npm i --save-dev react-addons-test-utils`
- `npm i --save-dev react-dom`
